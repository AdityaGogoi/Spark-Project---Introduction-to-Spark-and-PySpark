# Spark-Project---Introduction-to-Spark-and-PySpark
An introductory project in Spark and PySpark
While the Spark toolkit is in Scala, a language that compiles down to bytecode for the JVM, the open source community has developed a wonderful toolkit called PySpark that allows us to interface with RDDs in Python.
In theis project we will analyse the dataset which comprises names and information of all the guests that appeared on The Daily Show.
